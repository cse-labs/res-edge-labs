# Namespaces

A namespace provides a mechanism that enables a business organization to control which apps can be deployed by it.

## Overview

Namespaces are designed to give a business entity control of what applications are to be deployed to what clusters. This is accomplished by specifying an Included Clusters Expression to select what clusters are associated with the namespace.  A namespace is associated with an application providing the  relationship between the application and the cluster(s) for which the deployment manifests will begenerated.
