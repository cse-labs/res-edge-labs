# GitOps

## Flux Setup Files

- The Flux setup yaml is located in `clusters/central-la-nola-2301/flux-system`
  - A `Flux source` is a git repo / branch combination
  - A `Flux kustomization` is a directory within the source
    - flux-kustomization watches the flux-system and flux-system/listeners directories
    - You want to have multiple kustomizations (or helm)
      - When a kustomization fails, the entire process is aborted
        - This lets "your app" break "my app"
      - We create a kustomization per Namespace as part of Res-Edge-Automation (`ds cicd`)
- You can use any cluster in the clusters directory

## Create a new Codespace

- for testing, you can use the same Codespace
- if you do, you will need to recreate your cluster
  - deploy res-edge
  - run `ds cicd`
  - push to git repo

- Verify the K8s cluster is running

  ```bash

  kic pods

  ```

## Set Personal Access Token

- For long running GitOps, you need to create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)
  - Your GITHUB_TOKEN will expire after about a week
  - You can use GITHUB_TOKEN as your PAT but GitOps will eventually fail because the token is expired

```bash

export KIC_PAT=<yourGitHubPAT>

```

## Update Flux Template

- Edit apps/flux-system/source.yaml
  - Update `url:` and `branch:`

    ```bash

    code apps/flux-system/source.yaml

    ```

## Deploy GitOps (Flux v2)

- This deploys GitOps (Flux) to your cluster

```bash

cd "$REPO_BASE/clusters/central-la-nola-2301/flux-system"

# create the namespace
kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml

# create the Flux secret
flux create secret git flux-system -n flux-system --url "$KIC_FULL_REPO" -u gitops -p "$KIC_PAT"

# deploy the Flux components
kubectl apply -f components.yaml

# create the Flux Source
kubectl apply -f source.yaml

# check the source
kic check flux

# create the Flux Kustomization
# this single kustomization will manage all of the kustomizations generated by Res-Edge-Automation
kubectl apply -f flux-kustomization.yaml

# check flux
kic check flux

```

## Force Flux to Sync

- After making changes, you can force Flux to sync (reconcile)

```bash

kic sync

```

## Verify Flux Deployment

```bash

# make sure the pods Flux deployed are running
kic check pods --watch

# check heartbeat
kic check heartbeat

# check redis
# todo - need to implement
kic check redis

```

## Deploy IMDb App

- If you are using the same Res-Edge from previous labs, IMDb will be deployed as part of the previous step
  - You can skip this section

```bash

# assign the stores Group to the Namespace
curl -i -X PATCH http://localhost:32080/api/v1/namespaces/3 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "expression": "/g/stores" }'

# run cicd
ds cicd

# check changes into git
git add .
git commit -am "deployed imdb"
git push

# force flux to sync
kic sync

# wait for imdb pod (this takes about 60 seconds)
kic pods --watch

```

## Check IMDb App

```bash

kic check imdb

```
