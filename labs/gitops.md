# GitOps Lab

- In this lab, we will use GitOps (Flux) to deploy the Namespaces and Applications assigned to a Cluster
  - We refer to this Cluster as a "member cluster"
    - Member clusters can be listed with the `ds clusters list` command
    - We will use `central-la-nola-2301` as our member cluster name
      - You can use any cluster in the list

## Prerequisites

- Deploy the Res-Edge [data service](./deploy-res-edge.md)
- Assign a Group to the [imdb Namespace](./assign-group-to-namespace.md)

## Setup a clean environment

```bash

# start in the repo base directory
cd "$KIC_BASE"


# Warning: this will delete any existing data changes and they are not recoverable
ds reload --force

# redeploy IMDb
# will return 204 No Content
ds update namespace --id 3 --expression /g/stores

# run ci-cd locally
ds cicd

# deploy the clusters directory changes
ds deploy

```

## Flux Setup Files

- The Flux setup yaml is located in `clusters/central-la-nola-2301/flux-system`
  - A `Flux source` is a git repo / branch combination
  - A `Flux kustomization` is a directory within the source (flux-system in our case)
    - flux-kustomization watches the flux-system and flux-system/listeners directories
    - You want to have multiple kustomizations in your deployment
      - When a kustomization fails, the entire process is aborted
        - This lets "your app" break "my app" if we use the same kustomization
      - We create a kustomization per Namespace as part of Res-Edge-Automation (`ds cicd`)

## Setup Member Cluster

- Normally, the "member cluster" would be a separate cluster from the cluster running the data service
  - For simplicty, we are going to run our current cluster in both modes
  - Optionally, you can create a new Codespace that will be a "member cluster"

## Getting started

- Verify the data service is running

  ```bash

  ds check resedge

  ```

## Update Flux Template

- Edit apps/flux-system/source.yaml
  - Update `url:` and `branch:`

    ```bash

    code "$KIC_BASE/apps/flux-system/source.yaml"

    ```

## Run ci-cd

- Run ci-cd locally and check in any changes

  ```bash

  # run ci-cd locally
  ds cicd

  # update GitHub if necessary
  ds deploy

  ```

## Set Env Vars

- We use the GITHUB_TOKEN for Flux connectivity for convenience
  - The GITHUB_TOKEN will expire about a week after the Codespace is created
  - GitOps will fail once the token expires

```bash

export KIC_FULL_REPO=$(git remote get-url --push origin)
export KIC_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

if [ "$KIC_PAT" = "" ]; then
  export KIC_PAT=$GITHUB_TOKEN
fi

ds env

```

- For long running GitOps, you need to create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)
  - `export KIC_PAT=<YourGitHubPat>`
- Update `$HOME/kic.env` to make your GitHub PAT persistent across shells

## Deploy GitOps (Flux v2)

- This deploys GitOps (Flux) to your cluster

```bash

# change central-la-nola-2301 to deploy additional member clusters
cd "$KIC_BASE/clusters/central-la-nola-2301/flux-system"

# create the namespace
kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml

# create the Flux secret
flux create secret git flux-system -n flux-system --url "$KIC_FULL_REPO" -u gitops -p "$KIC_PAT"

# deploy the Flux components
kubectl apply -f components.yaml

# create the Flux Source
kubectl apply -f source.yaml

# this single kustomization will manage all of the kustomizations generated by Res-Edge-Automation
kubectl apply -f flux-kustomization.yaml

```

## Force Flux to Sync

- After making changes, you can force Flux to sync (reconcile)

  ```bash

  ds sync

  # check flux
  ds check flux

  ```

## Verify Flux Deployment

- Flux should create 3 new Namespaces
  - heartbeat
  - imdb
  - redis

```bash

# make sure the pods are running
kic pods --watch

# check heartbeat
ds check heartbeat

# check imdb
ds check imdb

# check redis
ds check redis

```

## Additional Member Clusters

- You can create additional Codespaces as member clusters
- Use a different Cluster name / directory for each cluster
